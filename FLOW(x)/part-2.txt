main focus on - registration form
(functionality for the registration form using Passport(npm). Also encrypt/hash the password using bcrypt(npm))

STEPS, (what m i doing??)--
**1. when user submit, its going to make a POST request to user/register **
2. on routes/user.js - POST code block added
3. the values which are entered by the user(on UI), will be stored in the variable(name,email.username,password)
4. validation of the above variables.
5. error msg display, if 1or more fields are missing<bug!! need to resolve>
6. If everything passes, what to do??? 
a. create a new user(mongodb)
b. defining the schema(username, pass, email, name)(models/user.js)
